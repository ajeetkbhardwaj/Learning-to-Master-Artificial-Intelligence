    "1. Aim to define the objectives in a business terms thus we frame questions accordingly to find the answer to it.\n",
    "   - How would the solution be used ?\n",
    "   - What are the current solutions/workarounds ?\n",
    "   - How should we frame the this particular problem ?\n",
    "   - How should performance be measured ?\n",
    "   - Is the performance measure aligned with the business objective ?\n",
    "   - What would be the minimum performance needed to reach the businees objective ?\n",
    "   - What are the comparable problems ? can we use previous methods or tools ?\n",
    "   - Is human experties available ?\n",

    "   - We check the legal obligations & get authorization if necessary.\n",
    "   - We get access authorization.\n",
    "   - We create a workspace with enough storage space.\n",
    "   - We get the data.\n",
    "   - We convert the data into a format we can easily manipulate.\n",
    "   - We ensure sensitive information is either deleted or protected.\n",

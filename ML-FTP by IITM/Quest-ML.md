1. How can we represent our data points as vectors ?
   - Practical : 
   - Abstract :
   - Algebraic Geometric :
   - Computational(our interest) :
2. What is numpy module in python ?
3. How we can represent the our data vectors as list in python ?
4. How we can represent the our data vectors as numpy arrays ?
5. Which data vector representationo is much more efficient, is it list or numpy array ?
6. How we can perform the addition of such data vectors ?
---

7. How we can perform the elementwise data vector multiplication ?

8. How we can perform the scalar multiplication on data vectors ?

9. How to apply the function on the data vectors ?

10. How to declare a data vector of zeros or ones ?
11. How to create a sequence of number in certain range ?


12. How to compute the norm of data vectors ?
    - Euclidean Norm : default
    - L1 Norm : order = 1(lasso)
    - L2 Norm : order = 2(ridge)
    - L0 Norm i.e max norm : order = 0

# [Practical Machine Learning by Ashish Tendulkar](https://study.iitm.ac.in/ds/course_pages/BSCS2008.html)


Understand the life cycle of a machine learning project - typical steps involved and tools that can be used in each step.

Using machine learning algorithms to solve practical problems using libraries like scikit-learn and tensorflow.

Fine tuning the algorithms through regularization, feature selection, and better models.

Develop an understanding of evaluation of machine learning algorithms and decide the next steps based on the analysis.
